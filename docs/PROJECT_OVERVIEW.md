## Project Vision

**Spitly** is a modern, AI-powered bill-sharing application designed to make splitting expenses among friends, roommates, and groups as effortless as possible. Our vision is to eliminate the awkwardness and complexity of managing shared expenses while ensuring fairness and transparency.

### Mission Statement

To provide a simple, fair, and transparent platform for managing shared expenses, reducing financial friction in relationships and groups through smart automation and clear accountability.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Bill Sharing

1. **Manual Calculation Errors**

   - People struggle with mental math when splitting bills
   - Discounts, taxes, and tips complicate calculations
   - Item-based splitting is tedious to calculate manually

2. **Payment Tracking Difficulties**

   - Hard to remember who has paid and who hasn't
   - No central record of payment history
   - Following up on unpaid debts feels awkward

3. **Group Expense Complexity**

   - Multiple bills among the same group create complicated debt webs
   - Need to track "who owes whom" across many transactions
   - Settling up requires multiple transfers

4. **Fairness Concerns**

   - Same person often ends up paying repeatedly
   - No objective way to ensure fair rotation of payers
   - Difficult to track if payment burden is evenly distributed

5. **Lack of Accountability**
   - No audit trail of changes and payments
   - Disputes arise from missing records
   - Can't prove payment history

### How Spitly Solves These Problems

1. **Automated Bill Splitting**

   - Two splitting methods: Equal split and item-based split
   - Automatic adjustment for discounts and taxes
   - Precise calculation eliminates disputes

2. **Centralized Payment Tracking**

   - Real-time payment status visibility
   - Automatic settlement detection
   - Payment history and audit trail

3. **Group-Wide Settlement**

   - Calculate net balances across all bills in a group
   - Minimize number of transactions needed
   - Clear payment instructions for final settlement

4. **AI-Powered Payer Selection** (Planned)

   - Fair rotation algorithm
   - Considers payment history and frequency
   - Suggests next payer objectively

5. **Comprehensive Activity Logging**
   - Every action is recorded
   - Transparent audit trail
   - Dispute resolution support

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **Bill Creation Flow**

   ```
   User Input → Validation → Calculate Splits → Create Bill Document
              → Create Activity Log → Notify Participants
   ```

2. **Payment Flow**

   ```
   Mark as Paid → Update Payment Status → Check Settlement
               → Create Activity Log → Notify Payer
   ```

3. **Settlement Flow**
   ```
   Select Bills → Calculate Net Balances → Minimize Transfers
               → Generate Settlement → Track Completion
   ```
